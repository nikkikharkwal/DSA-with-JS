Description

Santosh is a milk man, and supplies milk to local shops. Due to lockdown, the demand for milk has increased substantially but due to surge in the prices of Petrol & Diesel, he has incurred some loss. Santosh is thinking of someway to maximize this profit. He is a smart man, and hence figures out, that  if he delivers  4 or 8 containers of milk, on each trip ,gives him the maximum return. Therefore, he decides that he will only carry 4 or 8 containers of milk for every delivery. To find the maximum profit that he can get with this arrangement, find the number of ways in which he can deliver N containers of milk, if for each visit he takes only 4 or 8 containers with him.
