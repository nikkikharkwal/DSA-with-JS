/*
Description

You are given a string whose size is stored in a variable with the nameN, stored in a variable with the namestr

You have to print all the characters in the string, which are present at even indexes

For example, consider the string stored instr = "nrupul", and the value stored inN = 6, then the output will be

n
u
u

The characters stored at odd positions aren - index 0,u - index 2,l - index 4, hence they are printed, each character on a new line
Note : The indexing in the string starts from 0


Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inN

The next line of the input contains the value stored instr


Output
Print the characters at even indexes, as shown in the problem statement, each character on a new line


Sample Input 1 

6
ankush
Sample Output 1

a
k
s
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 6, and the value stored instr = "ankush"

Therefore, the characters at even positions are

a - 0, k - 2, s - 4

Therefore, the output becomes

a
k
s

        console.log(str[N]);
