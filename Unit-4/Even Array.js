/*
Description

You are given an array, stored in a variable with the sizearr

The size of the array is stored in a variable with the namen

You have to traverse the array, and print only the even elements in the array.

Print each number on a new line

For example, consider the array asarr = [1 2 3 4 5], and the value stored inn = 5

Then, the required output will be

2
4
The above are the only two even numbers in the given array


Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inN, the size of the array

The next line containsNspace separated numbers denoting the elements of the array


Output
Print the even elements present in the array, as explained in the problem statement


Sample Input 1 

5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1

2
4
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inn = 5and the value stored inarr = [1 2 3 4 5]

The only even numbers in the array are2 4

Therefore, the output will be

2
4

function evenArray(n, arr){
    if (n === arr.length){

    }
    if (arr[n] % 2 == 0){
    	console.log(arr[n]);
    }
    evenArray(n+1,arr);
    // The initial value of n = 0
}
